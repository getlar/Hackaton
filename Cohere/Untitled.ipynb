    "Prompt: Kledthe Cantankerous Cavalier A warrior as fearless as he is ornery, the yordle Kled embodies the furious bravado of Noxus. He is an icon beloved by the empire's soldiers, distrusted by its officers, and loathed by the nobility. Many claim Kled has fought in every campaign the legions have waged, has “acquired” every military title, and has never once backed down from a fight. Though the truth of the matter is often questionable, one part of his legend is undeniable: Charging into battle on his un-trusty steed, Skaarl, Kled fights to protect what's his… and to take whatever he can get. Kled generates some courage by killing minions, but gets much more from fighting Champions. The last hit of Violent Tendencies deals more damage than the first three - make sure you hit it! Chaaaaaaaarge!!! can be cast at a great range. Try and predict where the enemy team will be by the time you reach them.    Kled generates courage by damaging enemies with his Pocket Pistol and basic attacks, killing minions, and attacking structures or epic monsters. Watch Kled's courage bar when he's off his mount - when it reaches 100%, he will remount and regain a significant amount of health. Kled is much more threatening when he has Violent Tendencies ready. Fighter, Tank Kled throws a bear trap that damages and hooks an enemy champion. If shackled for a short duration, the target takes additional physical damage and is yanked toward Kled.<br><br>When dismounted, this ability is replaced by Pocket Pistol, a ranged gun blast that knocks back Kled and restores courage.

Kled dashes, dealing physical damage and gaining a short burst of speed. Kled can cast this ability again to dash back through his initial target, dealing the same damage. Kled and Skaarl charge to a location, leaving a speed-granting trail behind them and gaining a shield. Skaarl locks onto and rams the first enemy champion encountered. Kled rides his trusty steed, Skaarl, who takes damage for him. When Skaarl's health depletes, Kled dismounts.<br><br>While dismounted, Kled's abilities change and he deals less damage to champions. Kled can restore Skaarl's courage by fighting enemies. At maximum courage, Kled remounts with a portion of Skaarl's health.\n",

    "Prompt: LeeSin the Blind Monk A master of Ionia's ancient martial arts, Lee Sin is a principled fighter who channels the essence of the dragon spirit to face any challenge. Though he lost his sight many years ago, the warrior-monk has devoted his life to protecting his homeland against any who would dare upset its sacred balance. Enemies who underestimate his meditative demeanor will endure his fabled burning fists and blazing roundhouse kicks. Use Sonic Wave before Dragon's Rage so you can chase the target with Resonating Strike. Take advantage of Flurry by weaving in basic attacks between spell casts - this maximizes damage output and minimizes Energy loss. Self-casting Safeguard and using Iron Will are powerful tools for killing neutral monsters (in the jungle).\" Stay spread out to minimize the impact of Lee Sin's ultimate, Dragon's Rage. Lee Sin has powerful tools to combat physical damage in Iron Will and Cripple but he is still vulnerable to magic damage. Lee Sin relies heavily on following up with his abilities. Use disables to prevent him from chaining together his abilities and attacks. Fighter, Assassin Sonic Wave: Lee Sin projects a discordant wave of sound to locate his enemies, dealing physical damage to the first enemy it encounters. If Sonic Wave hits, Lee Sin can cast Resonating Strike for the next 3 seconds.<br>Resonating Strike: Lee Sin dashes to the enemy hit by Sonic Wave, dealing physical damage based on the target's missing Health. Safeguard: Lee Sin rushes to target ally, shielding himself from damage. If the ally is a champion, they are also shielded. After using Safeguard, Lee Sin can cast Iron Will for the next 3 seconds.<br>Iron Will: Lee Sin's intense training allows him to thrive in battle. For 4 seconds, Lee Sin gains Life Steal and Spell Vamp. Tempest: Lee Sin smashes the ground, sending out a shockwave that deals magic damage and reveals enemy units hit. If Tempest hits an enemy, Lee Sin can cast cripple for the next 3 seconds.<br>Cripple: Lee Sin cripples nearby enemies damaged by Tempest, reducing their Move Speed for 4 seconds. Move Speed recovers gradually over the duration. Lee Sin performs a powerful roundhouse kick launching his target back, dealing physical damage to the target and any enemies they collide with. Enemies the target collides with are knocked into the air for a short duration. This technique was taught to him by Jesse Perring, although Lee Sin does not kick players off the map. After Lee Sin uses an ability, his next 2 basic attacks gain Attack Speed and return Energy. \n",

    "Prompt: Lulu the Fae Sorceress The yordle mage Lulu is known for conjuring dreamlike illusions and fanciful creatures as she roams Runeterra with her fairy companion Pix. Lulu shapes reality on a whim, warping the fabric of the world, and what she views as the constraints of this mundane, physical realm. While others might consider her magic at best unnatural, and at worst dangerous, she believes everyone could use a touch of enchantment. Glitterlance can be fired at odd angles depending on where your cursor is - Moving your cursor closer to Pix and Lulu will change your area of effect size considerably. Consider casting Help, Pix! on ranged attackers for the Pix boost and Wild Growth on Tanks or Fighters for the added initiation power. The shots from Lulu's faerie can be intercepted - hide behind your minions to avoid the additional Faerie attacks. Lulu excels when opponents heavily commit. Don't give her this chance! Use heavy harass tactics instead to force Lulu and her partner out of lane. Support, Mage Pix and Lulu each fire a bolt of magical energy that damages and heavily slows all enemies it hits. If cast on an ally, grants them Attack Speed and Move Speed for a short time. If cast on an enemy, turns them into an adorable critter that can't attack or cast spells. If cast on an ally, commands Pix to jump to an ally and shield them. He then follows them and aids their attacks. If cast on an enemy, commands Pix to jump to an enemy and damage them. He then follows them and grants you vision of that enemy. Lulu enlarges an ally, knocking nearby enemies into the air and granting the ally a large amount of bonus health. For the next few seconds, that ally gains an aura that slows nearby enemies. Pix fires magical bolts of energy whenever the champion he's following attacks another enemy unit. These bolts are homing, but can be intercepted by other units. \n",

    "Prompt: Taliyah is a nomadic mage from Shurima, torn between teenage wonder and adult responsibility. She has crossed nearly all of Valoran on a journey to learn the true nature of her growing powers, though more recently she has returned to protect her tribe. Some have mistaken her compassion for weakness and paid the ultimate price—for beneath Taliyah's youthful demeanor is a will strong enough to move mountains, and a spirit fierce enough to make the earth itself tremble. Taliyah is a nomadic mage from Shurima, torn between teenage wonder and adult responsibility. She has crossed nearly all of Valoran on a journey to learn the true nature of her growing powers, though more recently she has returned to protect her tribe. Taliyah throws a volley of rocks in a target direction, moving freely as she casts. This creates Worked Ground below her. If Taliyah casts Threaded Volley on Worked Ground, she consumes the ground to throw a stronger boulder that slows enemies. Taliyah causes an area of ground to erupt and throws enemies within it in a direction of her choosing. Taliyah creates a slowing minefield. If enemies dash through it or are knocked through it, the mines explode and stun them. Taliyah creates a very long wall and then surfs it. Taliyah gains Move Speed near walls.\n",
